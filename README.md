fail2ban_pkg_state: indicates the package state; Allowed setting: present, latest
fail2ban_pkg_version: specify the specific package version you wish to install. When specifying a version, the state will be forced to present. When omitting the variable or leaving it empty it will install the package as specified by the state variable. Example value: '=0.8.13-1'

fail2ban_config: is a dict that can hold all settings for your jail.local file
fail2ban_jails: is a dict that can hold all jail configuration that goes in your jail.d directory (one jail per file). The dict key will be used as section name and filter value. So make sure this matches. The filter key will also be used to check if there are any custom filters that need to be copied to the remote host(s). Your custom filters should be stored under files/filters
remove_fail2ban_jails: list of custom fail2ban jails defined in the jail.d folder that can be removed
fail2ban_actions: holds a list with all custom actions that need to be copied to the remote host(s). Your custom actions should be stored under files/actions
